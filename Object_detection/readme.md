# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition in Vietnam using YOLOv8

## 📖 Introduction

This project studies and applies **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** to recognize traffic signs in Vietnam.
As intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles continue to grow, automatic traffic sign recognition becomes a crucial component to ensure **safety, accuracy, and real-time responsiveness**.

---

## 🧩 Motivation

* **Practicality**: Vietnam has a diverse system of traffic signs with various shapes, colors, and categories.
* **Challenges**: Lighting conditions, weather, viewing angles, and noise affect the accuracy of recognition.
* **Solution**: Applying YOLOv8 – a modern, high-speed model suitable for real-time detection.

## 📚 Theoretical Background

### Object Detection

* **Localization**: Determine object positions using bounding boxes.
* **Classification**: Identify the object type.
* **Optimization**: Data augmentation and fine-tuning to improve accuracy.

### Representative Models

* **R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN**: high accuracy but slow.
* **SSD**: fast but less accurate.
* **YOLO**: a good balance of speed and accuracy, suitable for real-time applications.

## 🗂️ Dataset

* The dataset includes various categories of traffic signs: **prohibitory, mandatory, guidance, warning**.
* Collected under real-world conditions: different lighting, weather, and viewing angles.
* Preprocessing steps: labeling, normalization, and creating the `mydataset.yaml` file.
